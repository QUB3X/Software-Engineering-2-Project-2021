\section{User Interface Design}
%  Provide an overview on how the user interface(s) of your system will
% look like; if you have included this part in the RASD, you can simply
% refer to what you have already done, possibly, providing here some
% extensions if applicable.

The RASD contains already several mockups of the mobile applications. Here we provide the flow diagrams describing the user experience of the client applications, which will be implemented by both the Mobile App and the Web App.
