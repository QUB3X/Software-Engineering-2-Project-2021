\section{Architectural Design}

\subsection{Overview}
% High-level component and their interaction
To ensure high maintainability, scalability and security, the service is structured according to the well-established three-tier architecture.
Figure \ref{fig:overview-architecture} shows how the tiers are divided, and what are the relations between key components of the system.

    \label{fig:overview-architecture}
\end{figure}

The main components are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mobile Application} The application is installed on the user's device through its store platform service. The application allows the user to interact with the service and receive notifications from the server.
    \item \textbf{Web Application} The web application allows users to access the same services available on the mobile app through any device, but it's not guaranteed that it can receive notifications. In addition to that, store managers may access a dedicated panel to configure additional parameters.
    \item \textbf{Static Web Server} It serves the client's browser a bundle that contains the web application code (compressed HTML and JS). It has no ties with the application server.
    \item \textbf{Application Server} It's the main backend component of the service, and contains the logic to process requests made against its API from the clients.
    \item \textbf{Database} It's the component that manages the connection to the database.
    \item \textbf{External Services} These services provides functionalities that the service can't provide by itself without additional infrastructure. They incluse a \emph{SMS Service} to send messages to users, a \emph{Notification Service} to send \emph{push} notifications to users and a \emph{Maps API} to visualize the location of the store on the user's device.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Selected Architectural Styles and Patterns}
%  Please explain which styles/patterns you used, why and how
\subsubsection{Architectural Styles}
\paragraph{Thick Client}
The main characteristic of thick clients is offering a wide variety of functionalities independent from the central server.
The main advantages it offers are greater decoupling of frontend and backend and a reduced computational effort on the application server.
Recent years have seen a rise in the adoption of single page application, with the advent of rich framework which allow to write code that can be run both in an app and in the browser.
This allows developers to reuse great part of code across a large number of devices, all using the same API offered by the backend.
The one page application will be served by a dedicated static webserver, which logically separate from the rest of the system.

\paragraph{REST API}
REST is an architectural style centered around the definition of a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations defined on top of the HTTP protocol.
Its main advantages are simplicity, scalability and modifiability.

\paragraph{Three layer architecture}
Separating presentation, business, and data layers offers great flexibility, maintainability and scalability.
This combined with a thick client means that the only communication between the client and the server goes trough a predefined API, without having to worry about eachother's internal representation.
