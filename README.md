## Project Goal ðŸš©

The assigned task was to design, implement and test a software prototype (called "CLup: Customer Line-up") to handle queues of supermarkets, in context of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The software allows customers to search and book a timeslot to do grocery shopping, as well as allowing store managers to setup timeslots and validate customers' bookings (i.e. through a QR).

## Skills acquired âœ…

- Writing a Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD)
- Writing a Design Document (DD)
- Writing an Implementation and Testing Document (ITD)
- Performing Acceptance Testing on another group's project
- Implementing a modern, scalable web-server with a REST API
- Performing Unit, Integration and System Testing

## Documentation ðŸ“„

- The RASD identifies the requirements, assumptions, constraints and provides an high-level description of the general architecture of the service, through UML diagrams and Use Cases. It was based on a template provided by the teacher. [RASD](https://github.com/QUB3X/Software-Engineering-2-Project-2021/blob/main/RASD/rasd.pdf)

- The DD provides a detailed but rather agnostic overview of how the service is structured, roles and interfaces for different users (customers, managers, totems), interactions between the parts of the system, reference for UI flow, REST API, and the test plan. [DD](https://github.com/QUB3X/Software-Engineering-2-Project-2021/blob/main/DeliveryFolder/dd_update-1.pdf)

- The ITD explains why and which technologies we've adopted, how the codebase is structured, and how to setup and run the project. [ITD](https://github.com/QUB3X/Software-Engineering-2-Project-2021/blob/main/ITD/itd.pdf)
