\subsection{Purpose}
This document is the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document for the Customers Line-Up system.
The purpose of this document is to describe the system focusing on scenarios, use cases, requirements and specifications,
analyzing what the software will do, how it will be used and the constraints under which it will operate.
This document is intended both for users and developers.

\subsection{Scope}
\info{here we include an analysis of the world and of the shared phenomena}

\emph{Customers Line-Up} (CLup) is a tool that allows supermarket managers to regulate the influx of people inside
physical stores and aims reduce the time spent by customers waiting in line, especially in emergency lockdown scenarios.

This tool reaches the goal by offering a number of functionalities, including:\todo{revise/add more}
\begin{itemize}
    \item access to the service via mobile app or website
    \item physical alternatives for people that do not have Internet access
    \item monitor the amount of people in a store
    \item book a visit, notifying customers of any change in the schedule
    \item suggest alternate stores and/or time frames
    \item track the time spent by customers to estimate waiting times
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Current System}
While there are already existing similar services, they are usually indipendent from store chains and
therefore have limited functionalities. CLup is a service that supermarket chains can implement alongside
their existing services. The system is as indipendent as possible from existing infrastructures, and
it can be used with minimal setup.
