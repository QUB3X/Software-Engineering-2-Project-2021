\subsection{Purpose}
This document is the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document for the Customers Line-Up system.
The purpose of this document is to describe the system focusing on scenarios, use cases, requirements and 
specifications, analyzing what the software will do, how it will be used and the constraints under which it
will operate. This document is intended both for users and developers.

\subsection{Scope}
\info{here we include an analysis of the world and of the shared phenomena}
In recent times, it has become clear that avoiding gathering of groups of people in small spaces is critical
for the safety of the population. During lockdowns some places became more crowded than others. 
This is the reason that lead to the development of various solutions to solve the problem, but all resulting
in roughly restricting the capacity of the building, without having a perfect knowledge of the people inside 
(as sometimes required by the law).\\
A definitive and articulated systems is therefore still missing. \\
This system will focus on solving the problem of queues in front of groceries stores but it can be generalized 
for queues handling in multiple scenarios.\\
\emph{Customers Line-Up} (CLup) is a system that allows from the prospective of supermarket managers,
to regulate the influx of people inside physical stores. On the other hand, from the consumer side, provides a way 
with which the time spent waiting in line is drastically reduced (or completely removed). 
This tool reaches the goal by offering a number of functionalities, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item access to the service via mobile app or website
    \item physical alternatives for people that do not have Internet access
    \item monitor and dynamically restrict the amount of people in a store
    \item book a visit, notifying customers of any change in the schedule
    \item suggest alternative stores and/or time frames
    \item track the time spent in the store by customers to provide better estimate of waiting times
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Current System}
While there are already existing similar services, they are usually independent from store chains and
therefore have limited functionalities. CLup is a service that supermarket chains can implement alongside
their existing services. The system is as independent as possible from existing infrastructures, and
it can be used with minimal setup.

\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{enumerate}[label={[G\arabic*]}]
    % Users
    \item Allow a User to sign up for an Account after providing a mobile phone number.
    \item Allow a User to book a visit to a specific store.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Allow a User to book a visit via Mobile App.
            \item Allow a User to book a visit via Website.
            \item Allow a User to book a visit in a specified time.
            \item Allow a User to book a visit as soon as possible.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Allow a User to find Stores nearby their current location.
    \item Allow a User to find Stores nearby a specified location.
    \item Allow a User to preview an estimate of the queue time.
    \item Allow a User to cancel their reservation.
    \item Allow a User to retrieve a scannable QR Code/Barcode that they must present in order to be granted access to a store.
    \item Allow a User without Internet access to retrieve a ticket from a physical location that counts as a reservation for a certain time.
    \item Allow a User to book for someone else.
    \item Allow a User to link their Account to the Store Loyalty Program.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Users do not have an Account cannot are not entitled to this feature.
        \end{enumerate}
    % Store
    \item The System notifies the Users affected by delay.
    \item The System shall postpone Users visits in case of a delay.
    \item The System shall not \request{Are we sure about this?}anticipate User visits when a User delete their reservation.
    \item The System must enforce the limits on the allowed number of concurrent Customers inside a store.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item There can be less Customers than the limit.
            \item There cannot be more Customers than the limit.
            \item The queue is updated each time a Customer exits or enters the store.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item The System shall not admit Users that arrive earlier, even if the current number of Customers isn't maximum.
    \item The System shall grant a User access only after the User's time of reservation.
    \item The System shall invalidate a User's reservation if they do not show up during a certain time interval.
    \item The System shall reserve a certain number of the allowed quote of customers for a special category of Users.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The system shall grant access to Users without a reservation that show up at the store and are pregnant women, elderly or with disabilities.
        \end{enumerate}
    % System Managers
    \item Allow System Managers to set a limit to the people allowed into the store at a time.
    \item Allow System Managers to not provide the physical ticket option.
    \item Allow System Managers to enable the link Account to Loyalty Program feature.
\end{enumerate}
