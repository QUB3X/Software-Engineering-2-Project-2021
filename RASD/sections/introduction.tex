\subsection{Purpose}
This document is the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document for the Customers Line-Up system.
The purpose of this document is to describe the system focusing on scenarios, use cases, requirements and 
specifications, analyzing what the software will do, how it will be used and the constraints under which it
will operate. This document is intended both for users and developers.

\subsection{Scope}
%\info{here we include an analysis of the world and of the shared phenomena}
In recent times, it has become clear that avoiding gathering of groups of people in small spaces is critical
for the safety of the population. During lockdowns some places become more crowded than others. 
This reason lead to the development of various solutions, all resulting roughly in restricting the capacity
of a building, without having a real knowledge of the number of people inside (as ofter required by the law).

A definitive and well-articulated system is still missing, especially considering that most people aren't much
tech-savvy, and especially elderly aren't familiar with the Internet.
According to recent statistics\footnote[1]{\url{https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/216672}}, in Italy over 30\% of the population has
never used the Internet, in particular only the 10\% of 75+ years old regularly use it; on the other hand many of
those able to surf the web do it through a smartphone and lack digital skills.

The proposed system will focus on solving the problem posed by queues in front of groceries stores but it could
be generalized for queues handling in multiple scenarios.

\emph{Customers Line-Up} (CLup) is a system that allows supermarket managers to regulate the influx of people
inside physical stores and giving customers a way to drastically reduce (or remove completely) the time spent
waiting in a queue. The idea of CLup is being more akin to an open-source framework that can be adoped and improved, rather
than it being a closed-source product.

This tool reaches the goal by offering a number of functionalities, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item access to the service via mobile app or website
    \item physical alternatives for people that do not have Internet access
    \item monitor and dynamically restrict the amount of people allowed in a store
    \item book a visit, notifying customers of any change in the schedule
    \item suggest alternative stores and/or time frames
    \item track the time spent in the store by customers to provide better estimate of waiting times
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{World Phenomena}
\begin{enumerate}[label={[WP\arabic*]}]
    \item new law on the limit on the maximum number of people in a store
    \item User reaches to the store
    \item User enters the store
    \item User exits the store
    \item User wants to shop
    \item User can't reach the store in time
    \item new store is built
    \item store is closed
    \item maximum number of people in a store is reached
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Shared Phenomena}
\begin{enumerate}[label={[SP\arabic*]}]
    \item User makes a reservation
    \item User joins Queue
    \item User cancels reservation
    \item User leaves the Queue
    \item System cancels reservation
    \item System kicks User out of Queue
    \item User scans the QR code
    \item The system is notified that an User has finished shopping
    \item Manager adds a store
    \item Manager removes a store
    \item Manager changes the maximum number of people allowed in a store
    \item Manager changes time and size of reservation slots
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Current System}
While there are already existing similar services, some are usually independent from store chains and
therefore have limited functionalities.
Notable examples are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://www.ufirst.com}{\emph{Ufirst}} allows customers to virtually get a number
        and get notified when it's their turn, offers an app for store managers and a tablet app for totems
        where a customer without a smartphone can get a ticket. Stores are required to register to make use
        of the service.
    \item \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codaliscia}{\emph{FilaIndiana}} allows customer to
        know how many people are in queue in front of a store by using GPS data from its userbase. Doesn't allow to
        book because it's indipendent from store chains. It's similar to what Google Maps offers with location-based
        crowd prediction.
    \item \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.anybot.quandospesa}{\emph{QuandoSpesa}} works similarly
        to \emph{FilaIndiana}, but allows users to select a certain time slot that is guaranteed to be the less crowded
        for all the app users.
    
\end{itemize} 
CLup is a service that supermarket chains can implement alongside their existing services. The system is as independent as possible from existing infrastructures, and it can be used with minimal setup.

\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{enumerate}[label={[G\arabic*]}]
    \item allow users to avoid crowds inside and outside the store
    \begin{enumerate}[label={[G1.\arabic*]}]
        \item allow users to join a virtual queue
        \item allow users to book a visit at a specific time
    \end{enumerate}
    \item allow users with special needs to have priority over regular users
    \item allow users to save time
    \item allow managers to have control over the maximum number in a store
    \item allow managers to get insights on the behavior of the users
    \item allow managers to monitor the current status of the store
\end{enumerate}
