\section{Specific Requirements}\label{sec:spec_req}

Here we include more details on all aspects in Section 2 if they
can be useful for the development team. 

\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
\subsubsection{User Interfaces}

The application is designed to allow the customer to make a reservation for a certain hour
or to register in the current queue of a supermarket. The first time the user opens the app,
they are prompted to register for an account: they have to provide their mobile phone number
(Fig. \ref{fig:mockup-welcome}), then they'll receive an SMS with a confirmation code
(Fig. \ref{fig:mockup-login}) to insert.
If the code inserted is the one sent to the phone number inserted in the first screen, the
account creation is successful.

If the registration is successful, the user can immediately see a map (Fig \ref{fig:select-store})
with stores nearby their location (they might have to allow the app do receive their location through
the OS API), otherwise they can manually search stores by typing an address.
Stores are also listed by distance and queue length.

Upon selecting a store (Fig. \ref{fig:store-details}), the current number of people in queue is shown to the user,
as well as the estimated waiting time in queue. They can choose to enter the queue as soon as
possible, or to pick an available time slot.

If they choose to pick a time slot, they are shown a list of time slots sorted by day (Fig. \ref{fig:select-timeslot}).
Upon confirmation, the user receive a receipt (Fig. \ref{fig:receipt}) with the date and time of their reservation,
and a QR code that they'll need to show when they present themselves at the store.

Should the customer queue for the first available time slot, then they will receive a similar receipt (Fig. \ref{fig:queue-ticket}),
that has a countdown of the time remaining in queue before their visit.

        \label{fig:queue-ticket}
    }
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}

To account for Customers without an Internet-connected device,
an interactive totem (Fig. \ref{fig:totem}) with a touchscreen display should be made available at each store entrance.
The totem is connected to Internet or the store local network.
It mirrors the key features of the web application, but it doesn't require the customer to
authenticate. Customers may reserve a time-slot, or enter the queue, but they won't be able to
be notified of possible changes. The reservation receipt is printed and the customer must keep it until they're
admitted to the store, otherwise they won't be able to enter.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/totem.pdf}
    \caption{The totem interface: (A) is the touchscreen display,
    (B) is where the printed ticket is emitted, (C) is a proximity sensor that wakes the
    totem when a client is nearby.}
    \label{fig:totem}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
In order to provide its full functionality to all users, the system will make use of the following software interfaces (APIs):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Maps}: to implement the functionality allowing the Users to look for a store the system will interface with a digital map service. Store Managers will be able to register on the map the position of their store.
    \item \textbf{Geolocalization}: geolocalization through GPS (when available) or other means (cellular, WI-FI or IP location) will be used in the web app and in the mobile app in order to show the User their current position and help them find a nearby store.
    \item \textbf{Mobile OS Notification Service}: notifications will be sent to warn and update Users in real time about their Reservations (if any) and the status of the Virtual Line (if it is joined).
    \item \textbf{SMS service}: an SMS with a secret code will be sent to the user upon login in order to verify their identity through a third party service.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
The backend of the system will expose a unified REST compliant API to communicate with all clients using HTTPS and TCP/IP.
The User will need a working Internet connection as well as cellular network upon login.
The Totem will be provided with WiFi, wired or cellular connectivity, depending on the physical constraints of each store.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
The system backend needs to handle a fair amount of customers, but little amount of data. It needs to be scalable, capable of load-balancing and reactive in order to notify customers on time. Protection against denial of service attacks would be necessary.
Since each store chain has to deploy its own version of this system, they should estimate server resources based on the average amount of customers visiting their stores.
Client-side and web applications must be responsive, fluid and handle correctly asynchronous interactions with the server (especially when the connection quality is bad), in order to provide the best experience possible to the end user.
\request{Do we really want to provide an estimate for customers? Like 1M Customers at launch or whatever}

\subsection{Design Constraints}
% Specify constraints on the system design imposed by external standards, regulatory requirements or
\subsubsection{Standards Compliance}
The system shall keep track of interactions with the system by the customers (i.e. joining the queue, entering the store, exiting the store).
The data should be named accordingly to this document (RASD) and the Design Document (DD).
All users sensible data shall be handled according to existing regulations, such as the GDPR.

\subsubsection{Hardware Limitations}
\todo{Check if it's ok, I didnt find much on this section in the IEEE ref}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mobile Application
    \begin{itemize}
        \item iOS or Android smartphone
        \item Cellular data connection
        \item WiFi
        \item GPS
    \end{itemize}
    \item Web Application
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Internet connection
        \item Computer with a display
        \item Major recent browser release (Firefox or WebKit based browser)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Backend
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Up-to-date webserver capable of virtualization
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% \subsubsection{Any Other Constraint}
\subsection{Software System Attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
The system infrastructure should have the lowest MTTR reasonably achievable; should the system need maintenance, it should take place outside store opening hours or during the weekend. It's important to prevent data loss through redundant storage methods.

\subsubsection{Availability}
The whole system doesn't need to be functional 24/7, but certain parts (i.e. backend for the web and mobile app) must be functional at all times; the totems can be powered off after a certain hour to save energy. The managers web portal should not be heavy on computing resources therefore it's feasible to keep it online all the time.
\subsubsection{Security}
To protect customers sensible data (i.e. phone number, visits to stores, location) the system should collect in first place the required minimum data possible, and store them in an encrypted database. The connections to the system should follow modern standard protocols (HTTPS over TLS) and be encrypted as well. Since managers must log in with username and password, those data should be encrypted and the password salted and hashed. The system could provide additional security by enabling two-factor authentication  (2FA).

\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The backend should be able to be updated without downtime, by using multiple instances behind a \emph{reverse proxy}.
Mobile applications can be updated through their OS app store.

\subsubsection{Portability}
The application must be available on major mobile OSs (Android and iOS) targeting at least the current release, even though the previous would be ideal.
The web application must run at least on the most recent browsers, but browser support can be limited.
It would be a smart choice to reuse most of the codebase across mobile and web by using cross platform tools.

The web server should be able to run on any major webserver, and support containerization.
