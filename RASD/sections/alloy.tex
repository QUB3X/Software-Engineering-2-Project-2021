\section{Formal Analysis using Alloy}
Alloy is a declarative language commonly used to describe, model, and verify complex systems.
Its objective is creating small models and checking their correctness, using the power of first order logic.
We used Alloy to model and verify the behavior of specific parts of the application.

\subsection{Queue Modeling}
Queue management is one of the most critical aspects of the application.

\subsection{Reservation Modeling}
Reservations are another critical aspect of the applications.
Users who make a reservation expect to shop at the specific time of the reservation.
In extreme cases reservations can be automatically cancelled by the system.
This should happen only in case of another user taking too long to shop.
The objective of this Alloy model is to verify that the presence of two concurent reservations at the same slot implies that one of the two has been cancelled by the system.
