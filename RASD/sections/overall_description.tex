\subsection{Product Perspective}

here we include scenarios and further details on the shared
phenomena and a domain model (class diagrams and state charts)

Customers Line-Up is developed for both shop managers and customers.
The intent is to provide functionalities adding value to the interactions between the two.
Managers will be able to understand more about their customers through insightful analytics and will avoid big crowds inside and outside their stores.
Customers will have an easy way of avoiding lines by booking a visit to stores, and will be aided in their selection of the best place and time.
\warning{va qua?}The system will have two modes, one for customers who have a registered account and one for customer who don't.
Customer who do not have an account will not be tracked and will not be able to receive advice.

The system will be developed from scratch, giving great flexibility.
The privacy of the customers will be guaranteed according to the latest privacy related norms.

\subsubsection{Scenarios}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
        \item Customer with \warning{is the mobile app a design choice?}Mobile App arrives in time:\\
            Ian wants to buy groceries to make a cake. Ian uses CLup to get a ticket for the supermarket with the shortest queue in his area.
            The app provides Ian with an estimate on the travel time (by car or by foot) and the time of the reserved slot. 
            Ian arrives at the supermarket in the correct time-slot, scans the generated \warning{design choice?}QR code and is granted access the store. Once he pays
            his groceries he scans again his QR code, so that he can increase the points associated with his account in this chain.
        \item Customer cancels the reservation:\\
            Luigi, after booking a visit to the store, remembers that he had a visit to the dentist at the same time.
            Since Luigi cares about others, he cancels his reservation, freeing up a time-slot to be used by other customers.
        \item Customer is unable to provide their code:\\
            Andrea books visit and reaches the store in time.
            However he is distractive and forgot to charge his phone, which turns off as he pulls it out of his pocket in order to show his code.
            \request{Come si gestisce? Nuovo o logga dal totem (ma poi si complica troppo il tutto)?}Andrea goes at the totem, makes a new reservation, and recieves a new code and a new time-slot.
    \end{enumerate}
