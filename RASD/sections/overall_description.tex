\subsection{Product Perspective}

here we include scenarios and further details on the shared
phenomena and a domain model (class diagrams and state charts)

Customers Line-Up is developed for both shop managers and customers.
The intent is to provide functionalities adding value to the interactions between the two.
Managers have access to a website that will help them to avoid large crowds inside and outside their stores, providing them with useful analytics.
Customers may avoid queues by booking visits to stores via website or mobile application, and will be guided in selectiong the best place and time.
Customers must register an account in order to utilize the website or the mobile app.
Customers who do not possess an Internet-connected device may still utilize the service via physical totems outside the stores.

The system will be developed from scratch, giving great flexibility and scalability.
The privacy of the customers will be guaranteed according to the latest privacy related norms.

\subsubsection{Scenarios}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
        \item \textbf{Customer with the mobile app arrives in time}\\
            Ian wants to buy groceries to make a cake. Ian uses CLup to get a ticket for the supermarket with the shortest queue in his area.
            The app provides Ian with an estimate on the travel time (by car or by foot) and the time of the reserved slot. 
            Ian arrives at the supermarket in the correct time slot, scans a code generated by the app and is granted access 
            the store. Once he pays for his groceries he scans again his code, so that he can increase the loyalty points associated with his store chain account.

        \item \textbf{Customer with no knowledge on the booking system}\\
            Pino is an elderly man. Pino knows nothing about Smartphones or Computers. Pino needs to buy a cake for his
            nephew's birthday party, so he decides to go to the local supermarket. When he arrives, he notices that the doors of the supermarket
            aren't opening. He reads the sign pointing him to a totem. 
            As soon as he approaches the machine, the machine activates itself an starts speaking with a reassuring voice. 
            The machine allows Pino to book a reservation to enter the store and instructs Pino on how to do so. 
            As soon as the time is up, Pino places his ticket onto the reader beside the door of the store, and he is granted access. 

        \item \textbf{Customer cancels the reservation}\\
            Luigi, after booking a visit to the store, remembers that he had a visit to the dentist at the same time.
            Since Luigi cares about others, he cancels his reservation, freeing up a time slot to be used by other customers.

        \item \textbf{Customer is unable to provide their code}\\
            Andrea books visit and reaches the store in time, but has forgot to charge his phone, which turns off as he pulls it out of his pocket in order to scan his code.
            Andrea goes at the totem, makes a new reservation, and receives a new code and a new time slot.
    \end{enumerate}

On one side of the system there is the system manager (single or multiple), who will monitor how the system is used and obtain useful information.
They are usually already familiar with othe customer relationship managers and already know what to expext from a control panel.

    \item \textbf{Tech-unfriendly}\\
        People who are not familiar with modern technologies. They have problems navigating complex application, and are more accustomed to talking to humans.
